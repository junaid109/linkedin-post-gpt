# How It Works
LinkedIn Post GPT is a powerful tool that generates personalized LinkedIn posts based on user preferences. Using the ChatGPT API and Vercel Edge functions with streaming, it constructs a prompt based on the user input and sends it to the ChatGPT API via a Vercel Edge function. The response is then streamed back to the application, allowing for quick and seamless post generation.
